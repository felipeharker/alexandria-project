# Harkitecture-Alexandria Research and Development

## Alexandria for Grasshopper (Public Application)

Alexandria is a collection of tools for Grasshopper for Rhino which allow users to input simple information such as an open/closed curve, a point, number slider, etc. to create complex 2D and 3D geometries, arrays, attractors, and patterns. This is a living project, and it will continue to grow as we use it. The more we use it, the more it will grow.

Alexandria greatly reduces the number of components an end-user must add and connect to their Grasshopper definition, while preserving customizability and control over the final result. With this plugin, new and experienced users can create parametric designs much faster and more easily than before.
